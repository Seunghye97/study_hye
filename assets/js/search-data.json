Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don&#39;t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist- I really believe he is Antichrist- I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my &#39;faithful slave,&#39; as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you- sit down and tell me all the news. If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10- Annette Scherer. Heavens! what a virulent attack! First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend&#39;s mind at rest, Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling? You are staying the whole evening, I hope? And the fete at the English ambassador&#39;s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there, My daughter is coming for me to take me there. I thought today&#39;s fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome. If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off, Don&#39;t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev&#39;s dispatch? You know everything. What can one say about it? What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours. Oh, don&#39;t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don&#39;t understand things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander&#39;s loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosiltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don&#39;t believe a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe! I think, that if you had been sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of Prussia&#39;s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea? In a moment. A propos, I am expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best French families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the good ones. And also the Abbe Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been received by the Emperor. Had you heard? I shall be delighted to meet them, But tell me, is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature. Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister, Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly beautiful. I often think, I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I don&#39;t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don&#39;t like him, Two such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so you don&#39;t deserve to have them. I can&#39;t help it, Lavater would have said I lack the bump of paternity. Don&#39;t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves he was mentioned at Her Majesty&#39;s and you were pitied.... What would you have me do? You know I did all a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That is the only difference between them. And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father there would be nothing I could reproach you with, I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is how I explain it to myself. It can&#39;t be helped! . titles = bs.find_all([&#39;h1&#39;, &#39;h2&#39;,&#39;h3&#39;,&#39;h4&#39;,&#39;h5&#39;,&#39;h6&#39;]) print([title for title in titles]) .

[&lt;div id=&#34;text&#34;&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes.

But how do you do? I see I have frightened you- sit down and tell me all the news.&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anna Pavlovna Scherer&lt;/span&gt;, maid of honor and favorite of the &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Empress Marya Fedorovna&lt;/span&gt;. With these words she greeted &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Prince Vasili Kuragin&lt;/span&gt;, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anna Pavlovna&lt;/span&gt; had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/span&gt;, used only by the elite. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows: &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10- Annette Scherer.&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;Heavens! what a virulent attack!&lt;/span&gt;&#34; replied &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;the prince&lt;/span&gt;, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anna Pavlovna&lt;/span&gt;, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend&#39;s mind at rest,&lt;/span&gt;&#34; said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?&lt;/span&gt;&#34; said &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anna Pavlovna&lt;/span&gt;. &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;You are staying the whole evening, I hope?&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;And the fete at the English ambassador&#39;s?

You know everything.&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;What can one say about it?&lt;/span&gt;&#34; replied &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;the prince&lt;/span&gt; in a cold, listless tone. &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Prince Vasili&lt;/span&gt; always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anna Pavlovna&lt;/span&gt; Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; In the midst of a conversation on political matters &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anna Pavlovna&lt;/span&gt; burst out: &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;Oh, don&#39;t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don&#39;t understand things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander&#39;s loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosiltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don&#39;t believe a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;I think,&lt;/span&gt;&#34; said &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;the prince&lt;/span&gt; with a smile, &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;that if you had been sent instead of our dear &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Wintzingerode&lt;/span&gt; you would have captured the &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;King of Prussia&lt;/span&gt;&#39;s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;In a moment. A propos,&lt;/span&gt;&#34; she added, becoming calm again, &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;I am expecting two very interesting men tonight, &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;le Vicomte de Mortemart&lt;/span&gt;, who is connected with the &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Montmorencys&lt;/span&gt; through the &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Rohans&lt;/span&gt;, one of the best French families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the good ones. And also the &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Abbe Morio&lt;/span&gt;. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been received by &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;the Emperor&lt;/span&gt;. Had you heard?&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;I shall be delighted to meet them,&lt;/span&gt;&#34; said &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;the prince&lt;/span&gt;. &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;But tell me,&lt;/span&gt;&#34; he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit, &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature.&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Prince Vasili&lt;/span&gt; wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying through the &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna&lt;/span&gt; to secure it for &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;the baron&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anna Pavlovna&lt;/span&gt; almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;the Empress&lt;/span&gt; desired or was pleased with. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,&lt;/span&gt;&#34; was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; As she named &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;the Empress&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anna Pavlovna&#39;s&lt;/span&gt; face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness. She added that &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Her Majesty&lt;/span&gt; had deigned to show &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Baron Funke&lt;/span&gt;, and again her face clouded over with sadness. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;The prince&lt;/span&gt; was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anna Pavlovna&lt;/span&gt; wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak he had done of a man recommended to &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;the Empress&lt;/span&gt;) and at the same time to console him, so she said: &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly beautiful.&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;The prince&lt;/span&gt; bowed to signify his respect and gratitude. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;I often think,&lt;/span&gt;&#34; she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation- &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I don&#39;t speak of &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anatole&lt;/span&gt;, your youngest. I don&#39;t like him,&lt;/span&gt;&#34; she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows. &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;Two such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so you don&#39;t deserve to have them.&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; And she smiled her ecstatic smile. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;I can&#39;t help it,&lt;/span&gt;&#34; said &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;the prince&lt;/span&gt;. &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;Lavater would have said I lack the bump of paternity.&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;Don&#39;t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves&lt;/span&gt;&#34; (and her face assumed its melancholy expression), &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;he was mentioned at Her Majesty&#39;s and you were pitied....&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;The prince&lt;/span&gt; answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly, awaiting a reply. He frowned. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;What would you have me do?&lt;/span&gt;&#34; he said at last. &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;You know I did all a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That is the only difference between them.&lt;/span&gt;&#34; He said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father there would be nothing I could reproach you with,&lt;/span&gt;&#34; said &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anna Pavlovna&lt;/span&gt;, looking up pensively. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is how I explain it to myself. It can&#39;t be helped!&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture. &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anna Pavlovna&lt;/span&gt; meditated. &lt;/div&gt;] . allText = bs.findAll( &#39;&#39;,{&#39;id&#39;:&quot;text&quot;}) print(allText) . [&lt;div id=&#34;text&#34;&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don&#39;t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist- I really believe he is Antichrist- I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my &#39;faithful slave,&#39; as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you- sit down and tell me all the news.&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anna Pavlovna Scherer&lt;/span&gt;, maid of honor and favorite of the &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Empress Marya Fedorovna&lt;/span&gt;. With these words she greeted &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Prince Vasili Kuragin&lt;/span&gt;, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anna Pavlovna&lt;/span&gt; had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;St. Petersburg&lt;/span&gt;, used only by the elite. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; All her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows: &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10- Annette Scherer.&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;Heavens! what a virulent attack!&lt;/span&gt;&#34; replied &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;the prince&lt;/span&gt;, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anna Pavlovna&lt;/span&gt;, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend&#39;s mind at rest,&lt;/span&gt;&#34; said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?&lt;/span&gt;&#34; said &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anna Pavlovna&lt;/span&gt;. &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;You are staying the whole evening, I hope?&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;And the fete at the English ambassador&#39;s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,&lt;/span&gt;&#34; said &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;the prince&lt;/span&gt;. &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;My daughter is coming for me to take me there.&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;I thought today&#39;s fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,&lt;/span&gt;&#34; said &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;the prince&lt;/span&gt;, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;Don&#39;t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev&#39;s dispatch? You know everything.&lt;/span&gt;&#34; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;What can one say about it?&lt;/span&gt;&#34; replied &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;the prince&lt;/span&gt; in a cold, listless tone. &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;What has been decided?

To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; In the midst of a conversation on political matters &lt;span class=&#34;green&#34;&gt;Anna Pavlovna&lt;/span&gt; burst out: &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#34;&lt;span class=&#34;red&#34;&gt;Oh, don&#39;t speak to me of Austria.

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive.

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
